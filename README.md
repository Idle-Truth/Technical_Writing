``` In this project we practiced an implemented skills relating to data interpretation, info-graphic design, and tailoring presentation of materials to a target audience. In the info-graphic provided I presented information about the potential effects of sea-level rise in the Fort Myers area and a chart showing the projected trend sea-level rise over the next twenty-five years.  This info-graphic serves the audience of Fort Myers locals the best as the data presented effects them the most directly. However, this info-graphic is designed in a way that makes it a valuable resource for everyone in areas at risk of the potential dangerous of sea-level rise and to those just wanting to learn more about the subject. ```

``` This proposal offers a potential subject of research for the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship into the threats of social engineering. I began by providing the objective of this research project and a step by step approach that will be taken to accomplish the objective of analyzing social engineering techniques. Next I provided background information into the different types of social engineering attacks and their associated definitions. Utilizing this information I proceeded to lay out the specifics of the project and key steps to ensure the data gained from the experiment was valid and usable. Finally, I wrapped up the proposal with an IRB statement and the expected outcomes of the project. Additionally, a timeline was added along with a work cited. During this assignment we learned and utilized the necessary skills to plan and produce a professional proposal. I look forward to utilizing a similar model to this assignment in my future career as new ideas are implemented into a DevOps cycle. ```
